### Strategy

The goal was to design a simple and accessible game platform that encourages social interaction while offering the familiar and fun experience of a universally loved game.

### Structural

The website structure follows a single-page design, making it easy for users to navigate the website and switch between the game and other information.

## Website Features

### Existing Features

- **Navigation Bar**: Displays the logo and provides quick access to game rules.
- **Switching Mode Button**: Allows switching between two-player mode and one-player vs. computer mode.
- **Game**: Fully interactive 3x3 tic-tac-toe board.
- **Reset Button**: Allows players to restart the game at any point.
- **Scoreboard**: Shows the scores at the bottom.
- **Footer**: Shows credits to the team.

### JavaScript Logic/Functionality

**Board Creation**

- The `createBoard` function generates a 3x3 grid dynamically using HTML.
- Each cell is styled and linked to an event listener for user interaction.
- This ensures that the game can reset and rebuild the board dynamically.

**Handling User Clicks**

- The `handleClick` function ensures that only empty cells can be selected.
- It updates the cell with the current player's symbol (X or O) and switches to the next player.
- If the game is already won or the cell is not empty, it prevents further interaction.

**Check for a Win**

- The `checkWin` function uses predefined `winningCombinations` to determine if a player has successfully aligned three symbols.
- It checks all cells in each combination to match the current player's symbol.
- If a winning combination is found, the cells are highlighted with a green background using the `highlight` function.

**Highlighting Winning Combination**

- The `highlight` function colours the winning cells to visually indicate the winning line.

**Check for a Tie**

- The `checkTie` function checks if all cells are filled without a winner.
- It uses the `Array.from` method to convert the cell list into an array and ensures none are empty.

**Update and Display Scores**

- The `updateScores` function keeps track of the scores for each player (X and O).
- It updates the DOM to display the current scores after each win.

**Game Reset**

- The `resetGame` function clears the board, resets the winning state, and prepares the game for a new round.
- It ensures that the background colour and symbols are cleared, and the game starts with player X.

**Dynamic Player Turn Indicator**

- The `endMessage` dynamically updates to show whose turn it is, whether the game is tied, or if thereâ€™s a winner.
- This ensures the user is informed at every stage of the game.

## Tablet/Mobile View

Responsive layout ensures the grid scales appropriately, and buttons are easily accessible on smaller screens. Interactive elements are optimised for touch input.

- AI opponent for single-player mode.
- Customisable themes for the game board.
- Multiplayer support over the internet.
